-- How would we know on which struct to put the `id` field?
-- It makes no sense to have more than one struct parameter.
-- @query f(u1: User1, u2: User2)
select 1 from users where id = :id /* :i64 */;

Error: Encountered a second struct parameter.

Note: First struct parameter defined here.

Hint: There can be at most one struct parameter per query.
